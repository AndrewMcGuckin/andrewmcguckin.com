# Portfolio Website - [andrewmcguckin.com](https://www.andrewmcguckin.com)

### A simple site to showcase current and future projects. 

The initial design is as follows:

![Portfolio Website Main Page light drawio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50446517/208998482-a088c99d-29eb-4491-8032-4bc3fc18f128.png)

The design will be expanded to include more information regarding Education, Work Experience and upcoming projects.

The site is hosted by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) with a simple 'Coming Soon' page currently live, this will be removed once the final design is complete.
